# Elf Inspector
This is an educational tool, made to consolidate some ELF concepts i've acquired.
It's a simple ELF binary file inspector that displays general header information, and program headers too.

# Usage
To use the program, first compile it with:
```
gcc elfinspect.c -o elfinspect
```
and then execute it with:
```
./elfinspect [target ELF file path]
```
